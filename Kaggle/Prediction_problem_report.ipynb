    "We attempted to create models using the following methods: Lasso, Neural Networks, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Mars, as well as various ensembles that included combinations of these. \n",
    "\n",
    "We had some initial breakthroughs ensembling lasso with catboost and lgbm. However, our best eventual models did not include it. We were a bit surprised by the lack of success of neural networks and xgboost. It was incredibly frustrating with neural networks, because we learned about this method in STAT-362 this quarter. We tried employing various tools in order to make the neural network complex, considering that this method has proven to be an industry standard at this point. However, none of our attempts with neural networks were able to accomplish an RMSE below 10. Similar things can be said with xgb as well. We found it surprising that lgb was more effective alongside catboost, considering that lgb is much less computationally expensive than xgb.\n",

    "Another issue I encountered was figuring which features to keep. Originally, I attempted to reduce dimensionality by eliminating features with high correlation with each other. We thought that this would address multicollinearity. However, it appeared that this was less productive than training our models (at least initially) on the entire dataset. We also though PCA might be worth our time, which is another concept we learned in STAT-362. However, we again found that this limited the success of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "On last issue that we should point out is the reproducability our code. When going through various iterations, it was difficult to keep track of which model iterations were more successful. While we did our best to keep track of our progress, we made some mistakes regarding setting the seed of our model/data preparation at a few stages. As a result, some of our best performing models were based on models that did not have a random_state set. When reviewing the code in this report, you might find that you are getting slightly different results from ours on Kaggle. This is due to this random_state issue. We can assure that the code presented is exactly how we went about creating our best model(s), and that the variance in result is purely based on the random_state (or lack thereof) for the various steps in the model creation."

It was also frustrating that the two models that worked best for us weren't even ones that we had learned in any of our classes.
